# DIY-Led-WS2812b-on-Honda-Motorbike
I made this project in 2023

My task is creating motorbike light such as: Brake light, Turning signal lamp, Hazard light, Starting Effect light by WS2812b Led

First, you need to download the Arduino IDE for programming. This is the URL of Arduino home page: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Second, you connect Arduino Nano board with your PC by its cable. Then, you upload the code in "code.txt" file into Arduino IDE and compile it.

Third, you need to see the "SH motorbike LED Circuit.jpg" for understanding the principle of my circuit which was set on motorbike. (note: SH is a kind of Honda Motorbike at my country). My circuit includes: Arduino Nano board, DC 12V to 5V power supply module, WS2812b LED Strip...
Lastly, turn on your motorbike and cheers!!!!

All the mp4 file is my achievement: "DIY LED on SH 2020 motorbike.mp4", "DIY Led on PCX motorbike.mp4", "DIY Led on tailing light of SH 2019 motorbike.mp4".
